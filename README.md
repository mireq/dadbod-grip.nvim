**Connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or DuckDB and edit tables like Vim buffers.** With DuckDB as a hub, attach any combination of these databases with `:GripAttach` and JOIN data across all of them in a single query. Open Parquet, CSV, and remote URLs as live tables. Connect to MotherDuck for cloud analytics. Rows are color-coded as you stage changes: teal for modified, red for deleted, green for inserted. A live SQL float generates the exact DML as you work. Preview the full mutation before it touches the DB, then apply in a single transaction. Reverse committed transactions. Navigate foreign keys through a breadcrumb trail. Browse schema in a sidebar with PK/FK markers and instant table open. Issue DDL through the UI: create tables, rename columns, drop with CASCADE. Profile column distributions with sparklines. Explain query plans in plain English. Generate SQL from natural language via Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama. Edit files in-place with `--write` and auto-refresh on a timer with `--watch`. Every Vim motion works. Nothing installs outside Neovim.

An example database is included. `:GripStart` opens it with seventeen tables and something in the consumer incidents that does not add up. See the [walkthrough](demo/softrear-internal.md) for the full investigation.

## Quickstart

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ "joryeugene/dadbod-grip.nvim" }
```

Then `:GripConnect` to pick your database. That's it. Schema sidebar + query pad open automatically.

### Connection strings

```
postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
mysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname
sqlite:path/to/file.db
duckdb:path/to/file.duckdb

/path/to/file.csv          ← direct file (also .parquet .json .xlsx)
https://host/data.parquet  ← remote file via httpfs

duckdb::memory:            ← single-query scratch (tables don't persist between queries)
```

### Cross-database federation (DuckDB as hub)

```vim
:GripAttach postgres:dbname=sales host=localhost user=me  pg
:GripAttach sqlite:legacy.db  legacy
:GripAttach md:cloud_analytics  cloud
```

Then query across all of them:

```sql
SELECT pg.customers.name, legacy.orders.total
FROM pg.customers JOIN legacy.orders ON pg.customers.id = legacy.orders.customer_id
```

Extensions install automatically. Attachments persist and restore on reconnect.

### DuckDB: Files, HTTPS, and S3

When your active connection is DuckDB, any file DuckDB can read becomes a live queryable table.

One-shot access (not saved to connections):

```vim
:GripOpen ~/data/report.parquet
:GripOpen https://example.com/dataset.parquet
:GripOpen s3://my-bucket/data.parquet
```

Save as a named connection (appears in `gc` every time):

```
gc → + New connection → paste file path or URL → give it a name
```

Cross-federation: local DuckDB + remote parquet + attached Postgres:

```sql
SELECT l.user_id, r.event_date, p.email
FROM local_events l
JOIN read_parquet('s3://my-bucket/events.parquet') r ON l.id = r.id
JOIN pg.users p ON l.user_id = p.user_id
```

DuckDB's httpfs extension installs automatically on first use. For S3 access, set
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in your environment. Public buckets
work without credentials.

## Features

### Multi-Engine and Federation
- **PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB, MotherDuck.** Schema browsing, inline editing, and metadata inspection for each engine.
- **Cross-database federation** via DuckDB. Attach a PostgreSQL production database and a local SQLite alongside a DuckDB analytics file with `:GripAttach`, then JOIN across all three with standard SQL.
- **MotherDuck cloud** works as a primary connection or as an attachment to a local DuckDB session.
- **Parquet, CSV, JSON, and remote URLs** open as live editable tables via DuckDB. No database connection needed for file queries.
- **Extensions auto-install.** Attaching `postgres:` loads `postgres_scanner`. Attaching `sqlite:` loads `sqlite_scanner`. No manual INSTALL/LOAD.
- **Attachments persist** in `.grip/connections.json` and restore automatically when you reconnect.

### Data Editing
- **Inline cell editing** with a popup editor, NULL handling, and type-aware display.
- **Visual change staging** with color-coded rows (teal=modified, red=deleted, green=inserted).
- **Pure SQL generation** with live preview before applying changes.
- **Transaction safety** wraps all DML in BEGIN/COMMIT with ROLLBACK on error.
- **Batch editing** in visual mode to set, delete, or NULL multiple rows at once.
- **Row cloning** via `c` duplicates the current row as a staged INSERT with primary keys cleared. Edit the PK fields, then apply.
- **Two-tier undo + redo**: local staging undo (50-deep) with `<C-r>` redo, plus transaction undo that reverses committed changes (10-deep, with confirmation). NULL values in typed columns (boolean, integer, geometry) are correctly restored as SQL NULL, not empty strings.
- **Mutation preview**: `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` from the query pad show affected rows before executing. SET values appear teal (modified), DELETE rows appear red, INSERT rows appear green. Press `a` to execute, `u` to cancel.

### Query and Navigation
- **Sort, filter, and pagination** using `s`/`S` to sort, `f`/`<C-f>`/`F` to filter, `gp`/`gP` for saved filter presets, and `H`/`L` to page (or `]p`/`[p`).
- **Foreign key navigation** via `gf` to follow a FK to its referenced row, and `<C-o>` to go back.
- **Query history** via `gh` or `:GripHistory` browsing all executed queries with timestamp and SQL preview, stored in `.grip/history.jsonl`.
- **Data profiling** via `gR` or `:GripProfile` showing sparkline distributions, completeness, cardinality, and top values per column.
- **Column statistics** via `gS` showing count, distinct, nulls, min/max, and top values.
- **Aggregate on selection** via `ga` in visual mode showing count/sum/avg/min/max.
- **Query Doctor** via `:GripExplain` translating EXPLAIN plans into plain-English health checks with cost bars and index suggestions.
- **AI SQL generation** via `A` or `:GripAsk` turning natural language into SQL queries using Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or local Ollama. AI reads existing query pad SQL to modify it rather than generating from scratch. Schema context cached per connection.

### Schema and Workflow
- **ER diagram** via `gG` rendering every table as a box with columns and type indicators, every foreign key as an arrow, and the full FK chain depth laid out left-to-right. Press `<CR>` on any table header to jump directly into that table's grid. Press `gG` again to return to the map. Works from the grid, the query pad, and the schema sidebar. Use it to navigate an unfamiliar schema the way you'd use a subway map.
- **Schema browser** via `:GripSchema` or `gb` showing a sidebar tree with columns, types, and PK/FK markers. `gb` opens/focuses the browser from any buffer; pressing `gb` from inside closes it.
- **Table picker** via `:GripTables` or `gT` / `gt` providing a fuzzy finder with column preview. Available from all three buffers: grid, query pad, and sidebar. In the sidebar, `go` opens the table under cursor with `ORDER BY created_at / PK DESC` so the latest rows appear first.
- **SQL query pad** via `:GripQuery` or `q` opening a scratch buffer that pipes results into editable grids.
- **Saved queries** via `:GripSave` and `:GripLoad` persisting to project-local `.grip/queries/` files.
- **Connection profiles** via `:GripConnect` or `gC` storing connections in `.grip/connections.json` with `g:dbs` backward compatibility. Connections auto-persist globally (`~/.grip/connections.json`) so they're available from any project. Connecting opens the full workspace (schema sidebar + query pad) automatically.
- **Data diff** via `:GripDiff` or `gD` comparing two tables by primary key with color-coded change highlighting. Auto-switches to compact layout on narrow terminals (<120 cols), toggle with `gv`.

### Schema Operations (DDL)
- **Table properties** via `gI` or `:GripProperties` showing columns, indexes, row count, and table size.
- **Column rename** via `R` in properties view or `:GripRename` with DDL preview and confirmation.
- **Column add/drop** via `+` and `-` in properties view with type prompts and destructive confirmation.
- **Create table** via `:GripCreate` or `+` in schema browser with an interactive column designer.
- **Drop table** via `:GripDrop` or `D` in schema browser with typed confirmation and CASCADE awareness.

### Display
- **Conditional formatting** that colors negatives red, booleans green/red, past dates dim, and URLs underlined.
- **Column hide/show** using `-` to hide, `g-` to restore all, and `gH` for a visibility picker.
- **Smart column auto-fit** that distributes extra terminal width to truncated columns.
- **Export to clipboard** in 6 formats via `gE`: CSV, TSV, JSON, SQL INSERT, Markdown, and Grip Table (box-drawing).
- **Export to file** via `gX` or `:GripExport`: saves the current result set as CSV, JSON, or SQL INSERT statements.

### Multi-Database
- **PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, and DuckDB** adapters with adapter-specific metadata queries.
- **Multi-schema PostgreSQL**: all schemas visible in sidebar (not just `public`). Tables from other schemas appear as `schema.table`.
- **File-as-table** support where `:Grip /path/to/data.parquet` opens Parquet/CSV/JSON/XLSX files via DuckDB.
- **Remote file querying** where `:Grip https://example.com/data.csv` opens remote files via DuckDB httpfs.
- **MySQL backslash safety**: MySQL sessions use `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` so backslashes in cell values are treated as literals, not escape characters. Values like `C:\path\to\file` round-trip correctly.

### File Modes: Watch and Write

Files opened via `:Grip` support two modes that turn static files into live, editable datasets.

**Write mode:** `:Grip /path/to/data.parquet --write`

Stage inline cell edits as normal, then press `a` to apply. Instead of running DML against a database, grip uses DuckDB's `COPY TO` to write the modified data back to disk in the original format. Parquet, CSV, TSV, JSON, NDJSON, and Arrow are all supported. A destructive-action confirmation fires before the file is overwritten. Remote `https://` URLs are always read-only regardless of the flag.

**Watch mode:** `:Grip /path/to/data.csv --watch` or `:Grip file.csv --watch=10s`

The grid re-runs the query on a timer and updates rows automatically. Default interval is 5 seconds; use `--watch=Ns` to set a custom one. Watch pauses while you have staged changes so you never lose in-progress edits to a background refresh.

Both modes are available from the connection picker and live on any open grid:

| | Connection picker | Open grid |
|---|---|---|
| Write mode | `!` on a `[file]` connection | `g!` to toggle |
| Watch mode | `W` on any connection | `gW` to toggle |

Active modes show as a colored badge in the grid's winbar: red `✎ WRITE` and blue `↺ 5s`. Modes are never persisted; always opt-in per session.

### Additional
- **Composite primary key support** for multi-column WHERE clauses.
- **Read-only mode** is auto-detected when no primary key exists.
- **DBUI integration** via `open_smart()` is optional since grip works standalone.
- **Live SQL floating preview** via `gl` shows real-time SQL as you stage changes.
- **Column type annotations** via `T` overlays type info on headers.
- **Row view transpose** via `K` shows a vertical column-by-column view of the current row. JSON cells are automatically pretty-printed inline.
- **JSON-aware editing**: pressing `i`/`<CR>` on a JSON cell pre-fills the editor with formatted, indented JSON for easy inspection and editing.

## Requirements

- **Neovim 0.10+**
- One or more database CLI tools in PATH:
  - **PostgreSQL**: `psql`
  - **SQLite**: `sqlite3`
  - **MySQL/MariaDB**: `mysql` (8.0.3+ for `--csv`, or MariaDB 10.5+)
  - **DuckDB**: `duckdb`

## Install

### lazy.nvim (recommended)

The plugin ships a `lazy.lua` spec so all commands work as lazy-load triggers automatically:

```lua
{
  "joryeugene/dadbod-grip.nvim",
}
```

**With keymaps** (recommended):

```lua
{
  "joryeugene/dadbod-grip.nvim",
  keys = {
    { "<leader>db", "<cmd>GripConnect<cr>",  desc = "DB connect" },
    { "<leader>dg", "<cmd>Grip<cr>",         desc = "DB grid" },
    { "<leader>dt", "<cmd>GripTables<cr>",   desc = "DB tables" },
    { "<leader>dq", "<cmd>GripQuery<cr>",    desc = "DB query pad" },
    { "<leader>ds", "<cmd>GripSchema<cr>",   desc = "DB schema" },
    { "<leader>dh", "<cmd>GripHistory<cr>",  desc = "DB history" },
  },
  opts = {},
}
```

**Demo** (Softrear Analyst Portal, no database needed):

```lua
{ "<leader>dd", "<cmd>GripStart<cr>", desc = "DB demo" },
```

**Recommended extras:**

```lua
-- SQL completion in query pad (auto-completes table/column names)
{ "kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion", ft = { "sql" } }
```

### packer.nvim

```lua
use {
  "joryeugene/dadbod-grip.nvim",
}
```

## Configuration

`setup()` is called automatically by the plugin loader with sensible defaults. Override if needed:

```lua
require("dadbod-grip").setup({
  limit         = 100,   -- default row limit for SELECT queries
  max_col_width = 40,    -- max display width per column
  timeout       = 30000, -- query timeout in ms (default: 10000; raise for slow tunnels)
})
```

AI SQL generation (optional):

```lua
require("dadbod-grip").setup({
  ai = {
    provider = nil,       -- nil = auto-detect, or "anthropic"/"openai"/"gemini"/"ollama"
    model = nil,          -- nil = provider default
    api_key = nil,        -- nil = env var, "env:VAR", "cmd:op read ...", or direct string
    base_url = nil,       -- override for ollama or proxy
  }
})
```

Provider auto-detection priority: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` > `OPENAI_API_KEY` > `GEMINI_API_KEY` > ollama (local). Explicit `provider` setting always wins.

## Usage

### Standalone Workflow (no DBUI needed)

```
:GripConnect    → pick a database → schema sidebar + query pad open automatically
```

That's the whole setup. One command. From there:
- `<CR>` on a table in the schema sidebar opens the grid
- `<C-CR>` in the query pad runs SQL into a grid
- `A` in the query pad generates SQL from natural language

Everything else (`:GripSchema`, `:GripQuery`, `:GripTables`) still works individually if you prefer.

### Quick Examples

```
:Grip users                           → open table in editable grid
:Grip SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 50   → run arbitrary SQL
:Grip /path/to/data.parquet           → open Parquet file via DuckDB
:Grip /path/to/data.csv --write       → edit file in-place (writes back on apply)
:Grip /path/to/data.csv --watch       → auto-refresh grid every 5s
:Grip /path/to/data.csv --watch=10s   → auto-refresh with custom interval
:Grip https://example.com/data.csv   → open remote file via httpfs
:GripConnect                          → pick a connection, open full workspace
:GripExplain                          → EXPLAIN current query in plain English
```

### DBUI Integration (optional)

If you also use [vim-dadbod-ui](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui), `open_smart()` detects DBUI context:

1. **DBUI SQL buffer**: opens that table, reuses the dbout window
2. **dbout result buffer**: traces back to the source table name
3. **Normal buffer**: uses the word under cursor as a table name

### Public API

```lua
local grip = require("dadbod-grip")

-- Optional config override (auto-called with defaults by plugin loader)
grip.setup(opts)

-- Direct open: table name or SQL, connection URL, view options
grip.open("users", "postgresql://localhost/mydb", { reuse_win = winid })

-- Smart open: auto-detects DBUI context
grip.open_smart()
```

```

Design principles:
- **Immutable state**: `data.lua` never mutates. Every operation returns a new state table.
- **Query as value**: `query.lua` treats query specs as plain Lua tables composed by pure functions.
- **I/O at the boundary**: Only `db.lua` and adapters run shell commands. Everything else is pure.
- **Adapter pattern**: URL scheme → adapter module. Each adapter implements query, execute, get_primary_keys, get_column_info, get_foreign_keys, get_indexes, get_table_stats, list_tables, and explain.
- **Transaction safety**: Apply wraps all DML in BEGIN/COMMIT with ROLLBACK on error.

## Testing

### PostgreSQL

```bash
createdb grip_test
psql grip_test < tests/seed_pg.sql
```

### SQLite

```bash
sqlite3 tests/seed_sqlite.db < tests/seed_sqlite.sql
```

### MySQL

```bash
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS grip_test"
mysql -u root grip_test < tests/seed_mysql.sql
```

### DuckDB

```bash
duckdb tests/seed_duckdb.duckdb < tests/seed_duckdb.sql
```

The SQLite DB (`tests/seed_sqlite.db`) is committed to the repo for zero-setup testing. Seed files share the same 13 tables + 1 view but each has adapter-specific types in `type_zoo` (e.g. PostgreSQL TSVECTOR/RANGE/MACADDR, MySQL SET/YEAR/GEOMETRY, DuckDB HUGEINT/STRUCT/MAP/UNION, SQLite type affinity coercion).

Open each table with `:Grip <table_name>` and verify rendering, editing, sort/filter/pagination, and FK navigation.

## Ecosystem

- **[vim-dadbod](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod)** started Vim database tooling. Optional. If installed, grip reads its `g:db`/`g:dbs` variables as connection sources for smooth migration from existing dadbod or DBUI setups.
- **[vim-dadbod-completion](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion)** adds SQL table and column completion in the query pad.
- **[vim-dadbod-ui](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui)** is a sidebar tree browser with saved queries. Optional since grip has its own schema browser and query pad.
