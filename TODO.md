# dadbod-grip.nvim - Roadmap

## v1.0.0 - Done

- [x] DataGrip-style editable data grids with box-drawing UI
- [x] Inline cell editing via float editor (e, CR to save, Esc cancel)
- [x] Visual change staging (modified=blue, deleted=red, inserted=green)
- [x] Live SQL preview (gs=preview, gc=copy, gl=live toggle)
- [x] Immutable state management (deep_copy on every transition)
- [x] PostgreSQL support (psql CLI)
- [x] DBUI integration (smart context detection from query/dbout buffers)
- [x] Composite primary key support
- [x] Read-only auto-detection (views, no-PK tables)
- [x] Row view transpose (K), column type annotations (T)
- [x] CSV export (y=cell, Y=row, gY=table)
- [x] Cell explain (ge), table info (gi)
- [x] Paste (p), undo (u/U), insert (o), delete (d), apply (a)
- [x] Full navigation: j/k/h/l/w/b/Tab/S-Tab/gg/G/0/^/$/{/}
- [x] NULL handling with sentinel values
- [x] Help popup (?) with ASCII art

## v1.1.0 - Multi-Database - Done

- [x] Adapter system (db.lua facade + adapters/ registry)
- [x] SQLite adapter (sqlite3 CLI, PRAGMA metadata, changes())
- [x] RFC 4180 CSV parser (multiline quoted fields)
- [x] Multiline cell display (↵ indicator)
- [x] SQLite test fixtures (seed_sqlite.sql, mirrors PG seed)
- [x] DuckDB adapter (duckdb CLI, information_schema, parquet/csv queries)
  - [x] File-as-table querying: `:Grip /path/to/data.parquet` (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel via DuckDB)
- [x] MySQL/MariaDB adapter (mysql CLI, information_schema)
- [x] MySQL test fixtures (seed_mysql.sql)
- [x] DuckDB test fixtures (seed_duckdb.sql)

## v1.2.0 - Sort, Filter, Paginate - Done

Low complexity, high impact. Every desktop GUI has these; no Neovim plugin does.

- [x] Sort by column: `s` toggles ASC/DESC/off, re-runs query with ORDER BY
- [x] Stacked sort: `S` adds secondary sort column
- [x] Quick filter: `f` on a cell to filter by "column = this value"
- [x] Filter rows: `<C-f>` opens freeform WHERE clause input
- [x] Clear filter: `F` removes filter and refreshes
- [x] Pagination: `]p`/`[p` next/prev page, status line shows "Page 1 of N"
- [x] Search within grid: `/` native vim search works on rendered buffer
- [x] Query composition module (query.lua) with pure functions, spec to SQL

## v1.3.0 - Foreign Key Navigation & Data Intelligence - Done

The single biggest gap in the Neovim database ecosystem. DataGrip, DBeaver, Postico, TablePlus all have FK navigation.

- [x] FK navigation: `gf` on a FK cell opens referenced row in new grid
- [x] FK metadata query per adapter (information_schema / PRAGMA foreign_key_list)
- [x] Navigation stack with `<C-o>` to go back, breadcrumb in title bar
- [x] Aggregate on selection: `ga` in visual mode shows count/sum/avg/min/max
- [x] Column statistics: `gS` on a column for count, distinct, nulls, min/max, top values
- [x] Additional export formats: `gE` picker for CSV, TSV, JSON, SQL INSERT, Markdown

## v1.4.0 - Grid Enhancements - Done

- [x] Column pinning/freezing: number keys (1-9) to freeze N leftmost columns (pspg-style)
- [x] Smart column auto-fit: distributes extra terminal width to truncated columns
- [x] Column hide/show toggle: `-` hide, `g-` restore, `gH` picker
- [x] Conditional cell formatting: negatives red, booleans colored, dates dimmed if past, URLs underlined
- [x] Batch edit: visual select rows, set all selected cells to same value (e/d/n in visual mode)
- [x] Copy/paste between cells: visual y yanks column slice, P pastes into consecutive rows
- [x] Undo history: multi-level undo stack (50 deep), u pops, U resets

## v2.0.0 - Standalone Workflow - Done

Makes vim-dadbod-ui optional. grip + vim-dadbod = complete DB workflow.

- [x] EXPLAIN plan viewer: `:GripExplain` renders query plan as color-coded tree
- [x] Transaction wrapper: BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK around staged changes (atomic apply)
- [x] Schema browser: `:GripSchema` / `go` sidebar tree with columns, types, PK/FK markers
- [x] Table picker: `:GripTables` / `gT` telescope/fzf-lua/native fuzzy picker with column preview
- [x] SQL query pad: `:GripQuery` / `gQ` scratch buffer into grip grid results
- [x] Saved queries: `:GripSave` / `:GripLoad` persists to .grip/queries/*.sql
- [x] Connection profiles: `:GripConnect` with .grip/connections.json + g:dbs compat
- [x] list_tables() adapter method for all 4 databases
- [x] Data diff: `:GripDiff` / `gD` compares tables with PK-matched row highlighting

## v3.0.0 - Schema Operations (DDL) - Done

- [x] Table properties view: `gI` / `:GripProperties` float with columns, indexes, stats
- [x] Column rename: R in properties view, `:GripRename` command
- [x] Column add/drop: + and x in properties view with DDL preview
- [x] Drop table: `:GripDrop` with typed confirmation and CASCADE awareness
- [x] Create table: `:GripCreate` interactive column designer

## Ongoing

- [x] Automated tests: 104 unit tests across 4 spec files, GitHub Actions CI
- [x] Performance: structural sharing in data.lua, sampled column widths, profiling
- [x] Documentation: vimdoc help file (doc/dadbod-grip.txt)
